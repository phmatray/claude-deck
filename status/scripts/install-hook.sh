# Idempotently installs the streamdeck-claude hook into Claude Code's
# user-global settings.json. Runs from WSL; can target either the WSL-side
# Claude install or the Windows-native one.
#
# The hook (notification.sh / notification.ps1) appends one JSON line per
# fire to <sid>.events.ndjson. The plugin replays the log through the state
# machine in src/session-events.ts to derive the icon state. We register the
# hook for every CC event whose semantics that machine knows how to handle —
# adding a new state means registering its event here AND adding a case in
# session-events.ts.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/install-hook.sh                 # default --target=wsl
#   bash scripts/install-hook.sh --target=wsl
#   bash scripts/install-hook.sh --target=windows
#
# For --target=windows: registers a hook command that invokes the repo's
# hooks/notification.ps1 directly over `\\wsl.localhost\<distro>\…` UNC.
# Nothing is copied. Override the Windows username with WIN_USER=<name>
# (default: julie) and the WSL distro with WSL_DISTRO_NAME (default: Ubuntu).
#
# Safe to re-run.
